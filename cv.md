## about myself
I was sudied in first class in high shool when i heard 
about programming and i was very interest on it.

I started learning frontend development because it appeared 
me easier to learn. I started from learning basic tools like
*HTML*,*CSS*,*DevTools* and *VScode*.

But i understand that my path will be much easier with course.
And saw ***The Rolling Scopes shool***, I'am very happy to 
study here.
